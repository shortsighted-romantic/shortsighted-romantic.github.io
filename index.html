			<h>The Mystical</h>
			<p>
				This setting was created by 2 gods, but the natural forces were not created with an initial balance and 
				the gods were too impatient to let natural forces settle into their own balance, so they created spirits 
				who would manipulate specific cycles to support life as the gods created. 
				<br><br>

				The gods may or may not be able to manipulate matter, but it is more important that they can magically 
				and persuasively manipulate thoughts and emotions. One is a patron of love, representing and able to 
				make people see beauty in any thing, person, or situation. The other is a patron of manipulation itself, 
				and can make people more convincing, or better at seeing through manipulation.
				<br><br>

				Not sure how physical the fae/spiritsâ€™ bodies are, but they can take solid visible form and are shape 
				shifters to some degree, so most of them look like animals or humanoids (might borrow steven universe 
				gem physics). Spirits each have control over the elements or forces involved in one natural cycle, and 
				can only appear with the colors in their listing:
				<ul>
					<li><img src="earth.png"/>The rock cycle (formation/destruction of islands/mountains, movement 
						of continents)</li>
					<li>The water cycle (rate of evaporation, movement of clouds, tides)</li>
					<li><img src="nitrogen.png"/>The nitrogen cycle (decay of waste)</li>
					<li>The carbon cycle (respiration, photosynthesis, burning)</li>
					<li><img src="life.png"/>Population (Birth rate and Death rate)</li>
				</ul>
				Spirits have no personal consequences for not using their abilities to support life. Both gods encourage 
			spirits to find their own love for the world as incentive to maintain it, but there are eras when many decide 
			not to, or decide to cause direct harm. Both the gods and the spirits tend to view humans as interesting play 
			things with little genuine concern for their feelings.

			<h>The People</h>
			<p>
				Theres a mortal spiritualist leader who interprets everything in nature as having motivations towards 
				individuals and peoples, sometimes like alternative medicine people who think nature must have provided 
				us with one magic cure all. She searches for meaning in the clouds. The fae like to visit her and others 
				like that, to tell semi harmless lies about their abilities and the other fae.
				<br><br>
				In contrast but not necessarily opposition, the other mortal oc I have a concept for has the energy of 
				the skids on letterkenny. The distinction between anger and fear as negative enciting emotions is an 
				important subject for art in this world, and this character is a famous personality and artist for the 
				horror genre. He's kind of a cult leader and have several methods of making their followers more 
				susceptible to manipulation, including drugs. He's partially intentionally evil but partially really 
				just being an edgelord thinking he's doing nothing wrong because people should let their lives be shit.
				<br><br>
				Both of these characters are products of how people in this world tend to project their own intentions 
				and feelings onto their surroundings and gravitate into idoltary.
				<br><br>
				Mortal fashion goes through cycles of color preference. usually stone and foliage colors (earthy) are 
				the norm, and those wanting to stand out wear flowery colors. Once in a while preferences go to neutral 
				grey scale, but then back to diverse colors. counterculture colors are usually mold colors since they 
				are considered gross and unusual.

			<h>The World</h>
			<p>
				Its a primitive planet with no woody trees, only grasses, reeds, and maybe palms, where people harvest 
				grains and tubers. There are 5 types of animals: snails, crabs, seahorses, tadpoles who are only frogs 
				for the last 3 months of their several year lives, and chickens. Just a bunch of beach chickens eating 
				tiny land crabs/snails. Crabs and snails vary widely in shape.
				<br><br>
				Due to the volatile personalities of the gods and as a result the people they created, human culture 
				goes through massive cultural and technological change all the time. I was going to start with hunter 
				gatherers and gradually have events and discoveries take place to see where it could end up, but careful 
				planning isn't in the spirit of the setting! Instead, you could write any culture, including any that 
				have or do exist in our world, and it could have existed in this world, if only for a short time in a 
				certain place. That means alternate histories are also valid in this setting. Contrivances and plot 
				patches are the name of the game.

			<h>Stories?</h>
			<p>
				It would be amazing if people made their own characters and stories for my world, but personally I would 
				rather just bounce ideas of fun interactions than have "official" stories!  If I did make something with 
				them, it would be very character focused, romantic, and moody, with symbolism that probably means 
				nothing.
